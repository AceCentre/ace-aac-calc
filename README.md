# AAC Based Scientific Calculator

<img src="./resources/logo.png" width="50" alt="AAC Calculator">

A scientific calculator project with multiple implementations - all with the aim to work with AAC Software:

1. [Vanilla HTML Calculator](#vanilla-html-calculator). This is the current main way we recommend to use this. Its offline, works in the browser and as such as a webview in a AAC software system such as the Grid. 
2. [Python CLI Calculator](#python-cli-version). This is a command line calculator that can be used in any system that can execute Python scripts. It requires either a pythoon interpreter or a comppiled version. We build this together with a web server that can be used to serve the calculator. 
3. [React Version](#react-version). This is a modern React implementation of the calculator. It is a work in progress and does not yet have all the features of the other implementations.



## Vanilla HTML Calculator
Located in `/vanilla-html/`
- Single HTML file calculator that runs in any browser
- No dependencies or installation required
- Supports keyboard shortcuts and memory operations
- Windows installer available for Grid 3 integration

### Input Methods

The calculator accepts both text and Unicode math symbols:

| Text Input | Symbol Input | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `sqrt(x)`  | `√x`        | Square root |
| `pi`       | `π`         | Pi constant |
| `*`        | `×`         | Multiplication |
| `/`        | `÷`         | Division |
| `^2`       | `²`         | Square |
| `^3`       | `³`         | Cube |
| `e`        | `ℯ`         | Euler's number |

### Example Expressions

#### Basic Math
```
2 + 2 = 4
1/2 × 20 = 10
√16 = 4
π × 2 = 6.283185307
```

#### Scientific Functions
```
sin(45) = 0.7071067812
log(100) = 2
√(π) = 1.7724538509
```

#### Random Numbers
```
rand() = 0.7324846372         # Random number between 0-1
floor(rand() * 6) + 1 = 4    # Roll a die (1-6)
floor(rand() * 100) + 1 = 42 # Random number 1-100
```

#### Algebraic Expressions
```
x^2 + 2x + 1                 # Quadratic expression
2x + 2y                      # Linear expression with variables
```

#### Memory Operations
- Store current result: Ctrl/⌘ + P (M+)
- Subtract from memory: Ctrl/⌘ + M (M-)
- Recall memory: Ctrl/⌘ + R (MR)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Enter` or `=` - Evaluate expression
- `Escape` - Clear workpad
- `↑` - Previous expression
- `↓` - Next expression
- `Alt/⌘ + D` - Toggle Degrees/Radians
- `Ctrl + (0-9)` - Set decimal places

### Tips
- Brackets are automatically completed as you type
- History is scrollable and expressions can be recalled
- Click the DP button or use Ctrl + number to set decimal places
- Toggle between degrees/radians for trigonometry
- Unicode symbols can be typed directly or using text equivalents

### Installation
Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/AceCentre/ScientificCalculator/releases) page.

## Python CLI Version
Located in `/python-cli/`
- Command-line interface calculator
- Python implementation with web server option
- Clipboard integration
- Designed for AAC software integration

### Features
- Command-line operation
- Clipboard monitoring mode
- Web server interface
- Full mathematical function support


### Examples

```bash
scicalc "2+2"              # Basic arithmetic
scicalc "sin(30)"          # Trigonometry (degrees)
scicalc "log₂(8)"         # Logarithms
scicalc "√16"             # Square root
scicalc "5!"              # Factorial
scicalc "200+10%"         # Percentages
scicalc "2π"              # Implicit multiplication
scicalc "2EE3"            # Scientific notation
```

### Output Formats

You can control how results are displayed using the `--return` option:

```bash
scicalc --return answer "2+2"        # Only shows the result: "4"
scicalc --return answer,calc "2+2"   # Shows both: "4\n2+2 = 4"
scicalc --return full "2+2"          # Shows full: "2+2 = 4" (default)
```

### Clipboard Integration

The calculator can interact with the system clipboard in two ways:

#### Watch Mode
```bash
scicalc --readpasteboard
```
This mode continuously monitors your clipboard. When you copy a mathematical expression, 
it automatically calculates the result and updates the clipboard with both the expression 
and its result. Great for doing a series of calculations!

#### Output to Clipboard
```bash
scicalc --output-to-pasteboard "2+2"
```
This copies the result directly to your clipboard instead of displaying it.
Can be combined with --return options:
```bash
scicalc --output-to-pasteboard --return answer "2+2"  # Only copies the number
```

Note: You cannot use --output-to-pasteboard with --readpasteboard

## Integration with AAC Software

This calculator is designed to work seamlessly with AAC software. The command-line interface makes it easy to:
- Call from any AAC software that can execute commands
- Copy results to clipboard for pasting
- Use with keyboard shortcuts or switch access

### Example AAC Integration

1. **Basic Calculation**: Set up a button that runs:
   ```bash
   scicalc --return answer "YOUR_EXPRESSION"
   ```

2. **Clipboard Watch Mode**: Create a button for continuous calculation:
   ```bash
   scicalc --readpasteboard
   ```
   Then users can copy expressions and get results automatically.

3. **Direct to Clipboard**: For AAC systems that work better with clipboard:
   ```bash
   scicalc --output-to-pasteboard --return answer "YOUR_EXPRESSION"
   ```

## Development

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies listed in pyproject.toml
- uv (Python package installer)

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scicalccli.git
cd scicalccli
uv pip install -e ".[test]"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Input Methods

The calculator accepts both text and Unicode math symbols:

| Text Input | Symbol Input | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `sqrt(x)`  | `√x`        | Square root |
| `pi`       | `π`         | Pi constant |
| `*`        | `×`         | Multiplication |
| `/`        | `÷`         | Division |
| `^2`       | `²`         | Square |
| `^3`       | `³`         | Cube |
| `e`        | `ℯ`         | Euler's number |

Examples:
- `2×π` or `2*pi` → `6.283185...`
- `√25` or `sqrt(25)` → `5`
- `3²` or `3^2` → `9`

Both notation styles work interchangeably, so you can mix and match based on your preference.


## React Version
Located in `/react/`
- Modern React implementation
- Component-based architecture
- Enhanced UI/UX
- Work in progress


(NB: this was the precursor to the vanilla html version. We are not actively developing it further. I ❤️ old skool html)

## Development
Each implementation has its own development setup. Its pretty obvious. Read the code.
